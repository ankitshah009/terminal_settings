Here I have placed the most used settings files for programmers. 
Have a look and send me suggestions if you have any.

<h2> Points: </h2> 

        1. Remember the file .bash_profile inside the bash folder would be hidden. 
        2. You can copy the contents of bash_profile to your ~/.bashrc if you're on linux. 
        3. I'm using a Mac and I have the ~/.bash_profile file as mentioned in the bash directory. 
        
<h2> How to place things: </h2>
        1. Place the files in the required directories. 
        On a mac: /usr/share/vim/vimrc
        on linux: /etc/vim/vimrc
        
        On a mac: ~/.bash_profile

Update the above files and run the following command, if you want to use the settings in the same session: 
        
        source ~/.bash_profile
